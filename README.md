# Bioplumber



bioplumber (pipes...haha) is a python package that aims to automate bioinformatics operations that are done usually manually. The idea is to make things more streamlined, reproduceable and avoid human errors as much as possible. Except in some simple cases bioplumber does not introduce new bioinformatics tools but it tries to use other tools in a (hopefully) user-friendly way. bioplumber uses an amazing python library called [textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) so that it can be used in terminal.
